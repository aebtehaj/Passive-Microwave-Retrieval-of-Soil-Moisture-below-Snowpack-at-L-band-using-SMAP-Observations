# Passive-Microwave-Retrieval-of-Soil-Moisture-below-Snowpack-at-L-band-using-SMAP-Observations

This repository presents a forward emission model and to simulate L-band microwave emission of wet soils below dry snowpack covered with an emerging moderately dense vegetation canopy. An inverse algorithm is also presented to retrieve soil moisture below snowpack using SMAP satellite data.
